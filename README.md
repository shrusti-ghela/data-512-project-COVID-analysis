# data-512-project-COVID-analysis

During the last three years we all have been experiencing a global pandemic. This has been tragic and disruptive to many countries and has taken a deep personal toll on many individuals and their families. 

One aspect that has been hard to miss in the last three years is the datafication of the pandemic. That is, many aspects of the individual toll of the pandemic have been collected, aggregated and re-represented as data. This datafication gives us the privilege to examine the pandemic from potentially many different perspectives to understand how it has changed lives and how it has changed society. To be honest, we are actually at the very beginning of understanding and comprehending these impacts.

During this Course Project you are going to begin taking a look at some of the social aspects of the pandemic by conducting a human centered data science analysis of some available COVID-19 data. In Part 1- Common Analysis, every student in the course will work from the same datasets. Students will be assigned to analyze data for one specific County of the United States.

## Part 1 - Common Analysis

Analyzing some of the social aspects of the pandemic by conducting a human centered data science analysis of available COVID-19 data for one specific County of the United States - Will County, Illinois. 
 
Question:
How did masking policies change the progression of confirmed COVID-19 cases from February 1, 2020 through October 1, 2021?

 ### Data: 
 
 - The RAW_us_confirmed_cases.csv file from the Kaggle repository of John Hopkins University COVID-19 data. This data is updated daily. You can use any revision of this dataset posted after October 1, 2022.
- The CDC dataset of masking mandates by county. Note that the CDC stopped collecting this policy information in September 2021.
- The New York Times mask compliance survey data.

## Part 2 - Project Extension

The number of fatal drug overdoses has increased since 2019 with treatment and harm reduction services complicated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this project is to understand the state of the drug epidemic in Will County during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project also includes demographic data that indicate a continuation of the reported racial disparities, with non-Hispanic Black or African American populations continuing to be disproportionally affected by drugs.

This analysis is important because this analysis can help us understand how COVID-19-specific circumstances might have contributed to overdose deaths across Will County and inform prevention and response efforts for future emergencies. 

Questions:

- How were fatal and non-fatal overdoses influenced by the pandemic?
- How were different demographic affected by the pandemic?

Part 4 - Project Report (1).pdf - Documentation of the end result for making it easier to reproduce. 

### Data: 

- "Overdoses.csv" consist of all the non-fatal overdoses recorded daily in Will County from 2018 to 2020
- "Overdose deaths.csv" consist of all the fatal overdoses recorded daily in Will County from 2018 to 2020
- "monthly.csv" consist of monthly overdoses in Will County for the years 2019 and 2020
